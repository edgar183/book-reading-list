# Book Reading Lists
The project is aimed for users that like to read books and make reading lists of books that they wish to read or have read or any other custom reading list.  
The website is build using Flask backend frameworks and Bootstrap front end with a relational database for storing the data and python for processing data.
[Hosted on Heroku](https://book-reading-lists.herokuapp.com/index)
## UX
 The user that is visiting the page can browse the list of all books that are stored in the database. In order to create or add any new data, the user must be registered. This allows users to create individual reading lists and add new books to a database that are not there yet.

### Interesting bugs
When editing the book, if any of dropdown lists are left empty the form will not be submitted and the page will crash as by default empty list object is still an object without id that is not saved in database.
## Deployment
#### Heroku
 1. Install Heroku on a local terminal sudo (Linux OS)
``` sudo snap install --classic heroku```
2. After you install the CLI, run the ``` heroku login -i ``` command. Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter your email and password for heroku
3. Create a new heroku app by typing this command in terminal ``` heroku create```
4. In order to push a new app to heroku, we need requirements.txt, this file has all versions of all installed packages in a local virtual environment and Procfile file. With this command ```git push heroku master``` we push the new app to heroku hosting server. 
5. In heroku dashboard under Settings -> Config Vars we need to add 
	- IP : 0.0.0.0
	- Port: 500
 	- SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI : sqlite:///db/bookLibrary.db
	- SECRET_KEY : ```user adds this```
#### Run app Locally
1. Clone repo from gitHub ```git clone https://github.com/edgar183/book-reading-list.git```
2. Install requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (may require ```sudo```)
3. Run the local development server: ```python manage.py runserver```
4. Navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8080 - you will be redirected to the home page

**Differenc** between development and production versions are:
- ```debug=True``` in run.py file,  development version
- ```debug=False``` in run.py file,  productions version
